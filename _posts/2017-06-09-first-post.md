Hey, it's just my first post!<br>


They say, "A jack of all trades is a master of none, but still better than a master of one.".  Hi, I'm Jack.  Well, my name is Skylin, actually, and I'm a mom and everything that comes with being Mom.  I'm also very ADHD and have a million and one hobbies and projects, I'm behind on everything, constantly running late, and I'm just all around a hot mess. I do my best though, and I find ways to manage the chaos, and as soon as I think I'm back on my feet, I loose my footing once again.  It doesn't help that when I have a list longer than Santa's, I think that is when I need to purchase a cheap Ukulele from the thrift store and restore it to a functioning instrument and learn to play ukulele.  And then when the ukulele project is taking longer than I expected, I decide to get my guitars out of storage to curb my musical appetite. So instead of doing the dishes that have been piling up for a few days, I'm "jamming out" trying to remember chords that I learned 15 years ago.


Anywho, this blog is one of those many projects/hobbies that comes with my ADHD and my slightly crazy neurospicy brain. I'm thrilled to be here and have my website up and running! I went to college for Computer Science with focus on Web development and programming. I'm really not very good at it, but I am a half-decent writer when I feel like it, so here I am beginning a blog on a website I created(ish). I say "ish" because I did borrow a template, because why do it from scratch when what I want has already been done? Even using a template isn't exactly a piece of cake though. Getting all the files in place and figuring out what needs to be edited and getting everything up and running together the way it's supposed to doesn't always go according to plan. So after a full day of tinkering with it, I think I finally figured it out. Tomorrow I'll begin moving over my Wordpress blog over here. Hooray!


My Main reason for wanting to switch over to GitHub vs Wordpress is because I'm cheap. I want to use some of those advanced features (like coding... css, javascript, etc), and I don't want to pay to have that functionality. I got a degree so I can bypass that fee dang it!


Anyway, thanks for stopping by. I apologize for the mess around here as things are still under construction, but I hope you'll come back again soon when things are a little bit prettier. Caoi! (Caoi? When do I say Caio?... I really don't know how to end a blog post... k bye.)
